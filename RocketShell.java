 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a tank rockets shell for a Greenfoot recreation of the 
 * Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It moves faster than the normal 
 * shells, does not bounce when hitting a wall or the boundary of the world and
 * destroys tanks and other shells that it hits. It also makes landmines that 
 * it intersects explode, but that is handled in the LandMine class.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
