 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a yellow enemy tank for a Greenfoot recreation of 
 * the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It is a tank with a medium 
 * speed, agile, that specialises in laying mines. It lays four mines randomly
 * and it can also do a suicide attack on the player.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made Yellow tanks do a suicide attack on the player where they
 * get close to the player, lay a mine then step on it to set it off.
