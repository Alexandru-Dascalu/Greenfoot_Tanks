 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a general tank turret for a Greenfoot recreation of the 
 * Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. 
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made this class a general tank turret and moved code to the 
 * PlayerTurret subclass.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Encapsulated keeping track of the number of shells fired by this
 * tank that are still in the world in this class and not the Tank class.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Made the shells be fired from the end of the turret's gun, not 
 * from the centre of the turret.
