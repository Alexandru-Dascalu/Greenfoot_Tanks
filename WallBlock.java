 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a wall block for a Greenfoot recreation of the Wii Tanks 
 * game for the Nintendo Wii. It forms part of a wall that obstructs the path of
 * tanks and shell.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Added code so that this object can detect what diagonal quadrant
 * of this wall block a point is in, used for when a target search or shell
 * needs to bounce.
 * <p>  -1.1 - Added isDestroyable method.
