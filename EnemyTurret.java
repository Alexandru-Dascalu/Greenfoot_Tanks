 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models an enemy turret for a Greenfoot recreation of 
 * the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It contains code used by all enemy 
 * turrets to detect the player tank and fire a shell. It's line of
 * sight bounces off walls as many times as the shells each type of enemy turret fires.
 * If it detects the player, it fires a shell, unless it already has
 * an x amount (depends on the subtype) shells fired by it still in the world. It 
 * also has a cooldown period, after which it will not fire another shell (each 
 * subtype has a different value for this period).
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Changed the code to allow enemy turrets to fire normal shells or 
 * rocket shells also.
