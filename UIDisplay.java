 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a general UI display for a Greenfoot recreation of the 
 * Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It should be treated as an abstract class
 * and you should only have objects if this class if they are also instances of
 * a subclass. It models a UI display that has a background image, over which some
 * text is displayed. Part of the text stays the same, another part is updated if
 * the data it displayed has been changed.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created a class for UI displays that update themselves.
