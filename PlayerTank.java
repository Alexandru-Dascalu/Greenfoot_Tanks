 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a player tank for a Greenfoot recreation of 
 * the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It is a tank controller by the player.
 * The player can drive the tank, fire shells and lay mines.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Encapsulated the turret actions of firing and aiming into this classes,
 * meaning the aim() and fire() methods are called by the tank's act() method.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Encapsulated mouse tracking into this class. The tank detects a
 * mouse click and then tells the turret to fire or lays a mine , depending on
 * the mouse button clicked.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Changed the class so player tanks can push other tanks it encounters.
 * <p>	-1.4 - Added a method that calculates the distance between the point at the 
 * given coordinates and this tank.
