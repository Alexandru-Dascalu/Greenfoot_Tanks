 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class describes a graph node used for finding the shortest path for a
 * Greenfoot recreation of the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It is a node 
 * in the graph of the game world. It has 8 neighbours, corresponding coordinates
 * in the game world, and class variables that allow it to be used for Diejkstra's
 * algorithm. These nodes are not meant to be placed in the game world in points 
 * through which a tank can not pass without hitting a wall.
