 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a player turret for a Greenfoot recreation of

 * the player's mouse and fires when told to by the tank it is installed on.s
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Encapsulated the turret actions of firing and aiming into the
 * tank class, and made the necessary changes here.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Encapsulated mouse tracking in the player tank class and made the 
 * necessary changes here.
