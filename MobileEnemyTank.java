 * 
 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a mobile enemy tank for a Greenfoot recreation of the 
 * Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. By default, it generates a path to 
 * follow in the game world using the world's graph, follows it, decides to 
 * move while turning or not, plays a sound when moving and tells it's turret 
 * to aim and fire. It is meant to be inherited always and you should not have
 * an actor that is just a MobileEnemyTank object since the class was not meant
 * to be used in this way.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made the tanks move more naturally by being able to move while
 *  turning if they can still get to the desired rotation by doing so and made
 *  the tank register reaching a point by being close to it, and not 
 *  necessarily at the exact coordinates.
 *  <p>	-1.2 - Made tanks not run into walls when they move while turning.
 *  <p>	-1.3 - Made tanks avoid land mines.
 *  <p>	-1.4 - Made tanks avoid shell.
