 * 
 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a general tank for a Greenfoot recreation of the Wii Tanks 
 * game for the Nintendo Wii. By default, it moves, plays a sound when moving
 * and tells it's turret to aim and fire. It is meant to be inherited always and
 * you should not have an actor that is just a Tank object since it the class was
 * not meant to be used in this way.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created a simple tank that does not move.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made the tank move using keyboard input.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Made the tank play a sound when moving.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Made the tank generate a simple tank turret on top if it when it
 * is added to the world.
 * <p>  -1.4 - Made the tank detect collisions with walls and not move into wall
 * blocks.
 * <p>  -1.5 - Modified this class to be a general tank class and moved part of 
 * code into the PlayerTank class, which inherits from this.
