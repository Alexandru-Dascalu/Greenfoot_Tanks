# Panzer_Batallion
A repository for a recreation of Wii Tanks in Java Greenfoot. This build is compatible with Greenfoot 3.5.2 . The cursor is visible because the newer versions of Greenfoot do not give any way for me to set the cursor to be invisible. The floaty feeling of the target is also only present in the new version of Greenfoot. Download the 3.1.0 compatible build if you want the mouse cursor to be gone.

The sprites used in this project for the tanks, turrets, shells, walls, world background and mines are all modified versions of sprites taken from https://www.kenney.nl/assets/topdown-tanks-redux . The original sprites are used under the CC0 1.0 Universal License, meaning they are in the public domain, and the modified sprites are under the same license. Huge thanks to the original creaters of the sprites, this game would not look so good without them! The turret bodies are modified from the turret sprite from https://opengameart.org/content/simple-2d-tank, also without copyright.

The target sprite is taken from http://chittagongit.com/icon/target-icon-5.html and is also without copyright.
The flame for the rocket shells is modified from a sprite taken from https://ubisafe.org/30/transparent-flame.html, also without copyright.

Every other sprite used is made by me and is free and under no copryright.
