# Panzer_Batallion
A repo for a recreation of Wii Tanks in Java Greenfoot.

This branch is a test branch with code that lets you visualize how the implementation of the shortest path algorithm works and how nodes are selected and visited. Nodes with a blue circle imgae have been visited and nodes with a red circle image are unvisited nodes whose distance have been updated when their neighbour has been visited.
