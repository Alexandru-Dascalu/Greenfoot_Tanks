# Panzer_Batallion
A repo for a recreation of Wii Tanks in Java Greenfoot.

This branch is a test branch with code that lets you visualize how the implementation of the shortest path algorithm works and how nodes are selected and visited. Nodes colored with a blue circle have been visited, and nodes currently having their distances updated(or not) when their neighbour is visited are briefly colored red.
