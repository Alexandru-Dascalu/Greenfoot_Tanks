 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p>This class models a target line for a Greenfoot recreation of the Wii
 * Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It is a small segment of an
 * interrupted line between the player's turret and the player target.
 * It moves when the player target and the turret move and has the same
 * rotation as the turret. There are a set number of these actors, and
 * the distance between each one increases when the distance between the
 * player turret and the target.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p> -1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p> -1.1 - Fixed a bug that would make the target lines be placed in the
 * wrong place if the game was reset inside Greenfoot.
