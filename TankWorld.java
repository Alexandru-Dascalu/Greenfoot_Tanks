 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a game world for a Greenfoot recreation of the Wii Tanks 
 * game for the Nintendo Wii. This game world is where all actors are placed, it
 * provides a tank target for the player, supports multiple levels displays
 * messages when a level is loaded or reloaded, when a mission is failed or 
 * cleared or when the player beats the game or loses.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Added a player tank target.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Made the mouse cursor to not show up next to the target.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Added external walls to the world.
 * <p>  -1.4 - Added code so that a message is displayed at the start of a level,
 * and appropriate messages are displayed when the mission is cleared or failed.
 * <p>  -1.5 - Made the game world support multiple levels and added a message for 
 * when the last level is beaten.
 * <p>	-1.6 - Added a graph of points in the world that are used to find the 
 * shortest path between a moving enemy tank and a selected point.
