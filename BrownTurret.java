 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a brown turret for a Greenfoot recreation of 
 * the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It is the most basic enemy
 * turret. It randomly turns around, looking for the player.It's line of
 * sight bounces off walls as many times as the shells it fires do.
 * If it detects the player, it fires a shell, unless it already has
 * 2 shells fired by it still in the world. It also has a cooldown period,
 * after which it will not fire another shell.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made the random turning be more varied.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Made the turret detect the enemy player if there is a straight
 * line to it.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Made the turret's line of sight bounce off walls as many times
 * as the shells it fires do.
 * <p>	-1.4 - Made the aiming of the turret more accurate.
 * <p>	-1.5 - Moved code for firing and detecting targets to a new class called
 * EnemyTurret that is the supertype of all enemy tank turrets and added methods
 * to allow different enemy turrets to have different stats.
 * <p>	-1.6 - Added some static variables and getters for the stats of a brown 
 * turret to work with the standard code from the enemy turret class.
