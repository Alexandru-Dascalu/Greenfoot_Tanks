 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class models a tank shell for a Greenfoot recreation of the Wii Tanks 
 * game for the Nintendo Wii. It moves, bounces (a limited number of times, else 
 * it dissapears) when hitting a wall or the boundary of the world and destroys
 * tanks and other shells that it hits. It also makes landmines that it intersects 
 * explode, but that is handled in the LandMine class.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created a shell.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Made the shell bounce.
 * <p>	-1.2 - The shell now destroys tanks and other shells it hits.
 * <p>	-1.3 - Changed the way the shell bounces so that it relies on code in the 
 * WallBlock class to detect in what quadrant of the block the shell hits. Now the
 * shells bounce more naturally.
