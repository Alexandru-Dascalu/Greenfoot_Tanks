 * <p><b>Purpose: </b>
 * <p> This class describes a graph used for finding the shortest path for a Greenfoot
 * recreation of the Wii Tanks game for the Nintendo Wii. It builds a network of
 * nodes base on an instance of a TankWorld so that nodes are where a tank can move
 * safely without hitting walls.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Added code to generate paths that avoid land mines.
 * <p>	-1.2 - Changed the way paths for avoiding mines are computed so as to not
 * repeat code in the getPathAvoidingMine method. The getter for points in the 
 * matrix now returns a non null neighbour if the point at the given coordinates
 * is null, and some minor refactoring to avoid exceptions.
