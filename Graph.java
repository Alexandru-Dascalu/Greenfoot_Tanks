 * <p> This class describes a graph used for finding the shortest path for a Greenfoot

 * nodes base on an instance of a TankWorld so that nodes are where a tank can move
 * safely without hitting walls.
 * 
 * <p><b>Version History</b>
 * <p>	-1.0 - Created the class.
 * <p>	-1.1 - Added code to generate paths that avoid land mines.
